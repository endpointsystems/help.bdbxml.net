# The Locking Subsystem

In order to allow concurrent operations, Figaro provides the locking subsystem. This subsystem provides inter- and intra- process concurrency mechanisms. It is extensively used by Figaro concurrent applications, but it can also be generally used for non-Figaro resources.


This section describes the locking subsystem as it is used to protect Figaro resources. In particular, issues on configuration are examined here.
