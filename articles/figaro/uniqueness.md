# Uniqueness

Uniqueness indicates whether the indexed value must be unique within the container. For example, you can index an attribute and declare that index to be unique. This means the value indexed for the attribute must be unique within the container.

By default, indexed values are not unique; you must explicitly declare uniqueness for your indexing strategy in order for it to be enforced.
