# Documentation Overview

The Figaro family of XML database APIs comes in Data Store (DS), Concurrent Data Store (CDS), Transactional Data Store (TDS), and High Availability (HA) editions, written for the Microsoft .NET Framework. While functionality is split into the different products, the documentation covers the entire family of editions; in other words, there is no documentation specific to Figaro DS that excludes the fuller functionality found in higher editions.
