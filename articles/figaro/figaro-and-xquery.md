# Figaro and XQuery

This section steps through some of the XQuery functionality provided by Figaro and then, using the [The dbxml Shell](xref:the-dbxml-shell.md) shell, introduces a few of the facilities Figaro provides that make working with XML highly efficient. Those unfamiliar with XQuery should first review one of the many excellent XQuery tutorials listed at the end of this document before proceeding.
