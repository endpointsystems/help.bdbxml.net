# XmlManager

@Figaro.XmlManager is a high-level class used to manage many of the objects that you use in a Figaro application. The following are some of the things you can do with @Figaro.XmlManager objects:

* Manage containers. This management includes creating, opening, deleting, and renaming containers (see [Managing XML Data in Containers](xref:managing-xml-data-in-containers.md)).
* Create input streams used to load XML documents into containers (see [Input Streams and Strings](xref:input-streams-and-strings.md)).
* Create @Figaro.XmlDocument, @Figaro.QueryContext, and @Figaro.UpdateContext objects.
* Prepare and run XQuery queries (see [Using XQuery](xref:using-xquery.md)).
* Create a transaction object (see the [Getting Started with Concurrent and Transactional Processing](xref:getting-started-with-concurrent-and-transactional-processing.md) guide for details).

Because @Figaro.XmlManager is the only way to construct important Figaro objects, and is central to your XML database application.
