# Languages and Platforms

Figaro is built on top of Oracle Berkeley DB XML and is a platform extension for the .NET Framework. Oracle provides language extensions for Berkeley DB XML for the Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Tcl languages. Because Oracle Berkeley DB XML is available under an open source license, a growing list of third-parties (in addition to [Endpoint Systems](http://endpointsystems.com)) provide Berkeley DB support in languages other than those that are officially supported.

Berkeley DB is supported on a very large number of platforms. Check with the Oracle Berkeley DB website and the mailing lists for the latest news on supported platforms, as well as for information as to whether your preferred language provides Berkeley DB support.
