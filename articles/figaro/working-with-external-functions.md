# Working with External Functions

Figaro allows you to define your own functions using the .NET Framework that you can access from XQuery. To do this, you must provide an implementation of @Figaro.XmlExternalFunction, and you must implement a @Figaro.XQueryResolver class that resolves which external function to call.
