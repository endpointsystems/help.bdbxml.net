# Getting Started with Concurrent and Transactional Processing

This guide describes how to use transactions with your Figaro XML database applications. It is intended to describe how to transaction protect your application's data. The APIs used to perform this task are described here, as are the environment infrastructure and administrative tasks required by a transactional application. This book also describes multi-threaded Figaro applications and the requirements they have for deadlock detection.


This guide is aimed at the software developer interested in writing a concurrent and/or transactional Figaro .NET application.


This guide assumes that you have already read and understood the concepts contained in the [Developing .NET Apps with Figaro](xref:developing-dotnet-apps-with-figaro.md) guide.
