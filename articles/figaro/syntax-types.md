# Syntax Types

Beyond the index type, you must also identify the syntax type. The syntax describes what sort of data the index will contain, and it is mostly used to determine how indexed values are compared. There are a large number of syntax types available to you, such as substring, boolean, or date.


See [Specifying Index Strategies](xref:specifying-index-strategies.md) for a complete list of syntax types available to you.
