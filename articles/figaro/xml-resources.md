# XML Resources

## Developer News and Resources
* [XML.com](https://www.xml.com/)
* [IBM Developerworks XML portal](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/)
* [OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards)](https://www.oasis-open.org/), which includes such member standards as [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/), [IDTrust](http://www.oasis-idtrust.org/), [LegalXML](http://www.legalxml.org/), [Data Center Markup Language (DCML)](http://www.dcml.org/), and [e-gov](http://www.oasis-egov.org/) solutions. 

## Standards and Vocabularies

Among its multiple uses, XML is also a _metalanguage_ - a syntactic basis for defining further languages. Those languages are the applications themselves, and not to be confused with software applications containing code. Here are a few examples of essential XML vocabularies:

* [Darwin Information Typing Language (DITA)](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/standards/x-ditaspec.html) for technical documentation built by IBM
* [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) for machine-readable texts in the humanities, social sciences and linguistics
* [DocBook](http://docbook.org/docs/), a publishing language developed by [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/)
* [Math Markup Language (MathML)](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/standards/x-mathmlspec.html) for expressing mathematical and scientific content
* [Resource Description Framework](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/standards/x-rdfspec.html) for describing collections of formalized statements about a Web resource
* [XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO)](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/standards/x-xslfospec.html) A great introductory article for XSL-FO can be found [here](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/17/xsl-fo/index.html)
* [JATS](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/) (Journal Article Tag Suite) is an application of [NISO Z39.96-2015](http://www.niso.org/workrooms/journalmarkup), which defines a set of XML elements and attributes for tagging journal articles and describes three article models.
