# Introduction

This topic provides a thorough introduction and discussion on transactions as used with Figaro. It begins by offering a general overview to transactions, the guarantees they provide, and the general application infrastructure required to obtain full transactional protection for your data.

>[!NOTE]
>Transactional processing is a feature of the Figaro Transactional Data Store (TDS) or High Availability (HA) product. These objects and the functionality discussed is not available for Figaro Data Store (DS) or Figaro Concurrent Data Store (CDS) editions.

This topic also provides detailed examples on how to write a transactional .NET application. Both single threaded and multi-threaded (as well as multi-process applications) are discussed. A detailed description of various backup and recovery strategies is included in this documentation, as is a discussion on performance considerations for your transactional application.
