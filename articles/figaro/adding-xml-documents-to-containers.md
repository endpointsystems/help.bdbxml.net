# Adding XML Documents to Containers

To manage XML documents in Figaro, you must load them into a container. Typically you will do this by using the 

@Figaro.Container handle directly. You can also load a document into an @Figaro.XmlDocument instance, and then load that instance into the container using the 

@Figaro.Container handle.
