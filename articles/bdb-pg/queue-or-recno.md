# Queue or Recno?

The Queue or Recno access methods should be used when logical record numbers are the primary key used for data access. The advantage of the Queue access method is that it performs record level locking and for this reason supports significantly higher levels of concurrency than the Recno access method. The advantage of the Recno access method is that it supports a number of additional features beyond those supported by the Queue access method, such as variable-length records and support for backing flat-text files.

Logical record numbers can be mutable or fixed: mutable, where logical record numbers can change as records are deleted or inserted, and fixed, where record numbers never change regardless of the database operation. It is possible to store and retrieve records based on logical record numbers in the Btree access method. However, those record numbers are always mutable, and as records are deleted or inserted, the logical record number for other records in the database will change. The Queue access method always runs in fixed mode, and logical record numbers never change regardless of the database operation. The Recno access method can be configured to run in either mutable or fixed mode.

In addition, the Recno access method provides support for databases whose permanent storage is a flat text file and the database is used as a fast, temporary storage area while the data is being read or modified.
