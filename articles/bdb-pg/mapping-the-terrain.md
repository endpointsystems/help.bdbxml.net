# Mapping the terrain: theory and practice

The first step in selecting a database system is figuring out what the choices are. Decades of research and real-world deployment have produced countless systems. We need to organize them somehow to reduce the number of options.

One obvious way to group systems is to use the common labels that vendors apply to them. The buzzwords here include "network," "relational," "object-oriented," and "embedded," with some cross-fertilization like "object-relational" and "embedded network". Understanding the buzzwords is important. Each has some grounding in theory, but has also evolved into a practical label for categorizing systems that work in a certain way.

All database systems, regardless of the buzzwords that apply to them, provide a few common services. All of them store data, for example. We'll begin by exploring the common services that all systems provide, and then examine the differences among the different kinds of systems.
