# Database Statistics

The <xref:Database.PrintStats> method returns a set of statistics about the underlying database, for example, the number of key/data pairs in the database, how the database was originally configured, and so on.

The <xref:Database.PrintFastStats> method returns only information that can be acquired without traversing the entire database.
