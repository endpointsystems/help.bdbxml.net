<p>To enable transactions for your environment, you must initialize the transactional subsystem. Note that doing this also initializes the logging subsystem. In addition, you must initialize the memory pool (in-memory cache). Frequently, but not always, you will also initialize the locking subsystem.</p>
<p>Creating transaction-protected applications using Figaro is quite easy. Applications first use <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.FigaroEnv.html#Figaro_FigaroEnv_Open_System_String_Figaro_EnvOpenOptions_">Open(String, EnvOpenOptions)</a> to initialize the database environment. Transaction-protected applications normally require all four subsystems, so the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.EnvOpenOptions.html#Figaro_EnvOpenOptions_InitMemoryBufferPool">InitMemoryBufferPool</a>, <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.EnvOpenOptions.html#Figaro_EnvOpenOptions_InitLock">InitLock</a>, <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.EnvOpenOptions.html#Figaro_EnvOpenOptions_InitLog">InitLog</a>, and <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.EnvOpenOptions.html#Figaro_EnvOpenOptions_InitTransaction">InitTransaction</a> flags should be specified. Or, you can also use the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.EnvOpenOptions.html#Figaro_EnvOpenOptions_TransactionDefaults">TransactionDefaults</a> flag which includes all four of these subsystems.</p>
<p>Once the application has called <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.FigaroEnv.html#Figaro_FigaroEnv_Open_System_String_Figaro_EnvOpenOptions_">Open(String, EnvOpenOptions)</a>, it opens its databases within the environment. Once the databases are opened, the application makes changes to the databases inside of transactions. Each set of changes that entails a unit of work should be surrounded by the appropriate <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.XmlTransaction.html">XmlTransaction</a> calls. The access methods will make the appropriate calls into the Lock, Log and Memory Pool subsystems in order to guarantee transaction semantics. When the application is ready to exit, all outstanding transactions should have been committed or aborted.</p>
<p>Databases accessed by a transaction must not be closed during the transaction. Once all outstanding transactions are finished, all open containers should be closed. When the containers have been closed, the environment should be closed by calling <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.FigaroEnv.html#Figaro_FigaroEnv_Close">Close()</a>.</p>
<p>Notice in the example below that you first create the environment handle, and then you provide the handle to the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.XmlManager.html">XmlManager</a> constructor. You do this because you cannot use transactions with the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.XmlManager.html">XmlManager</a> instance&#39;s default internal environment.</p>
<p>Notice in the following example that you first create the environment handle, and then you provide the handle to the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.XmlManager.html">XmlManager</a> constructor. You do this because you cannot use transactions with the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.XmlManager.html">XmlManager</a> instance&#39;s default internal environment.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-C#">const EnvOpenOptions options = 
                                // create the environment
                                EnvOpenOptions.Create |
                                // initialize locking
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitLock | 
                                // initialize logging
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitLog |
                                // initialize memory cache
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitMemoryBufferPool |
                                // initialize transactions
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitTransaction;

    var env = new FigaroEnv();
    // open the environment home directory
    env.Open(homePath, options);
    // initialize the manager with the specified environment
    var mgr = new XmlManager(env);

    // your database operations go here

    // close our un-adopted environment
    env.Close();
</code></pre><p>You then create and/or open your containers as normal. The only difference is that you must pass the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.ContainerConfig.html#Figaro_ContainerConfig_Transactional">Transactional</a> flag to the <a class="xref" href="../api/Figaro.XmlManager.html#Figaro_XmlManager_OpenContainer_Figaro_ContainerConfig_">OpenContainer(ContainerConfig)</a> or Figaro.XmlManager.CreateContainer(Figaro.ContainerConfig) method. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-C#">const EnvOpenOptions options = 
                                // create the environment
                                EnvOpenOptions.Create |
                                // initialize locking
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitLock | 
                                // initialize logging
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitLog |
                                // initialize memory cache
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitMemoryBufferPool |
                                // initialize transactions
                                EnvOpenOptions.InitTransaction;

    // configure a container for transactions
    var cfg = new ContainerConfig
                  {
                      AllowCreate = true,
                      Transactional = true
                  };
    var env = new FigaroEnv();
    // open the environment home directory
    env.Open(homePath, options);
    // initialize the manager with the specified environment
    var mgr = new XmlManager(env);

    // open a transactional container
    var trans = mgr.CreateTransaction();
    var container = mgr.OpenContainer(trans, cfg);
    trans.Commit();

    // your database operations go here

    // close our un-adopted environment
    env.Close();
