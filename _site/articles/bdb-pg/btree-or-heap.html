<h1 id="btree-or-heap">Btree or Heap?</h1>

<p>Most applications use Btree because it performs well for most general-purpose database workloads. But there are circumstances where Heap is the better choice. This section describes the differences between the two access methods so that you can better understand when Heap might be the superior choice for your application.</p>
<p>Before continuing, it is helpful to have a high level understanding of the operating differences between Btree and Heap.</p>
<h2 id="disk-space-usage">Disk Space Usage</h2>
<p>The Heap access method was developed for use in systems with constrained disk space (such as an embedded system). Because of the way it reuses page space, for some workloads it can be much better than Btree on disk space usage because it will not grow the on-disk database file as fast as Btree. Of course, this assumes that your application is characterized by a roughly equal number of record creations and deletions.</p>
<p>Also, Heap can actively control the space used by the database with the use of the DB-&gt;set_heapsize() method. When the limit specified by that method is reached, no additional pages will be allocated and existing pages will be aggressively searched for free space. Also records in the heap can be split to fill space on two or more pages.</p>
<h2 id="record-access">Record Access</h2>
<p>Btree and Heap are fundamentally different because of the way that you access records in them. In Btree, you access a record by using the record&#39;s key. This lookup occurs fairly quickly because Btree places records in the database according to a pre-defined sorting order. Your application is responsible for constructing the key, which means that it is relatively easy for your application to know what key is in use by any given record.</p>
<p>Conversely, Heap accesses records based on their offset location within the database. You retrieve a record in a Heap database using the record&#39;s Record ID (RID), which is created when the record is added to the database. The RID is created for you; you cannot specify this yourself. Because the RID is created for you, your application does not have control over the key value. For this reason, retrieval operations for a Heap database are usually performed using secondary databases. You can then use this secondary index to retrieve records stored in your Heap database.</p>
<p>Note that an application&#39;s data access requirements grow complex, Btree databases also frequently require secondary databases. So at a certain level of complexity you will be using secondary databases regardless of the access method that you choose.</p>
<p>Secondary databases are described in <a href="xref:secondary-indexes.md">Secondary indexes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="record-creationdeletion">Record Creation/Deletion</h2>
<p>When Btree creates a new record, it places the record on the database page that is appropriate for the sorting order in use by the database. If Btree can not find a page to put the new record on, it locates a page that is in the proper location for the new record, splits it so that the existing records are divided between the two pages, and then adds the new record to the appropriate page.</p>
<p>On deletion, Btree simply removes the deleted record from whatever page it is stored on. This leaves some amount of unused space (&quot;holes&quot;) on the page. Only new records that sort to this page can fill that space. However, once a page is completely empty, it can be reused to hold records with a different sort value.</p>
<p>In order to reclaim unused disk space, you must run the DB-&gt;compact() method, which attempts to fill holes in existing pages by moving records from other pages. If it is successful in moving enough records, it might be left with entire pages that have no data on them. In this event, the unused pages might be removed from the database (depending on the flags that you provide to DB-&gt;compact()), which causes the database file to be reduced in size.</p>
<p>Both tree searching and page compaction are relatively expensive operations. Heap avoids these operations, and so is able to perform better under some circumstances.</p>
<p>Heap does not care about record order. When a record is created in a Heap database, it is placed on the first page that has space to store the record. No sorting is involved, and so the overhead from record sorting is removed.</p>
<p>On deletion, both Btree and Heap free space within a page when a record is deleted. However, unlike Btree, Heap has no compaction operation, nor does it have to wait for a record with the proper sort order to fill a hole on a page. Instead, Heap simply reuses empty page space whenever any record is added that will fit into the space.</p>
<h2 id="cursor-operations">Cursor Operations</h2>
<p>When considering Heap, be aware that this access method does not support the full range of cursor operations that Btree does.</p>
<p>On sequential cursor scans of the database, the retrieval order of the records is not predictable for Heap because the records are not sorted. Btree, of course, sorts its records so the retrieval order is predictable.</p>
<p>When using a Heap database, you cannot create new records using a cursor. Also, this means that Heap does not support the DBC-&gt;put() DB_AFTER and DB_BEFORE flags. You can, however, update existing records using a cursor.</p>
<p>For concurrent applications, iterating through the records in a Heap database is not recommended due to performance considerations. This is because there is a good chance that there are a lot of empty pages in the database if you have a concurrent application.</p>
<p>For a Heap database, entire regions are locked when a lock is acquired for a database page. If there is then contention for that region, and a new database page needs to be added, then Berkeley DB simply creates a whole new region. The locked region is then padded with empty pages in order to reach the new region.</p>
<p>The result is that if the last used page in a region is 10, and a new region is created at page 100, then there are empty pages from 11 to 99. If you are iterating with a cursor, then all those empty pages must be examined by the cursor before it can reach the data at page 100.</p>
<h2 id="which-access-method-should-you-use">Which Access Method Should You Use?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, you can only determine which access method is superior for your application through performance testing using both access methods. To be effective, this performance testing must use a production-equivalent workload.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few times when you absolutely must use Btree:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use bulk put and get operations.</li>
<li>If having your database clustered on sort order is important to you.</li>
<li>If you want to be able to create records using cursors.</li>
<li>If you have multiple threads/processes simultaneously creating new records, and you want to be able to efficiently iterate over those records using a cursor.</li>
</ul>
<p>But beyond those limitations, there are some application characteristics that should cause you to suspect that Heap will work better for your application than Btree. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application will run in an environment with constrained resources and you want to set a hard limit on the size of the database file.</li>
<li>You want to limit the disk space growth of your database file, and your application performs a roughly equivalent number of record creations and deletions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inserts into a Btree require sorting the new record onto its proper page. This operation can require multiple page reads. A Heap database can simply reuse whatever empty page space it can find in the cache. Insert-intensive applications will typically find that Heap is much more efficient than Btree, especially as the size of the database increases.</p>
