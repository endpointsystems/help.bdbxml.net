<h1 id="hash-or-btree">Hash or Btree?</h1>

<p>The Hash and Btree access methods should be used when logical record numbers are not the primary key used for data access. (If logical record numbers are a secondary key used for data access, the Btree access method is a possible choice, as it supports simultaneous access by a key and a record number.)</p>
<p>Keys in Btrees are stored in sorted order and the relationship between them is defined by that sort order. For this reason, the Btree access method should be used when there is any locality of reference among keys. Locality of reference means that accessing one particular key in the Btree implies that the application is more likely to access keys near to the key being accessed, where &quot;near&quot; is defined by the sort order. For example, if keys are timestamps, and it is likely that a request for an 8AM timestamp will be followed by a request for a 9AM timestamp, the Btree access method is generally the right choice. Or, for example, if the keys are names, and the application will want to review all entries with the same last name, the Btree access method is again a good choice.</p>
<p>There is little difference in performance between the Hash and Btree access methods on small data sets, where all, or most of, the data set fits into the cache. However, when a data set is large enough that significant numbers of data pages no longer fit into the cache, then the Btree locality of reference described previously becomes important for performance reasons. For example, there is no locality of reference for the Hash access method, and so key &quot;AAAAA&quot; is as likely to be stored on the same database page with key &quot;ZZZZZ&quot; as with key &quot;AAAAB&quot;. In the Btree access method, because items are sorted, key &quot;AAAAA&quot; is far more likely to be near key &quot;AAAAB&quot; than key &quot;ZZZZZ&quot;. So, if the application exhibits locality of reference in its data requests, then the Btree page read into the cache to satisfy a request for key &quot;AAAAA&quot; is much more likely to be useful to satisfy subsequent requests from the application than the Hash page read into the cache to satisfy the same request. This means that for applications with locality of reference, the cache is generally much more effective for the Btree access method than the Hash access method, and the Btree access method will make many fewer I/O calls.</p>
<p>However, when a data set becomes even larger, the Hash access method can outperform the Btree access method. The reason for this is that Btrees contain more metadata pages than Hash databases. The data set can grow so large that metadata pages begin to dominate the cache for the Btree access method. If this happens, the Btree can be forced to do an I/O for each data request because the probability that any particular data page is already in the cache becomes quite small. Because the Hash access method has fewer metadata pages, its cache stays &quot;hotter&quot; longer in the presence of large data sets. In addition, once the data set is so large that both the Btree and Hash access methods are almost certainly doing an I/O for each random data request, the fact that Hash does not have to walk several internal pages as part of a key search becomes a performance advantage for the Hash access method as well.</p>
<p>Application data access patterns strongly affect all of these behaviors, for example, accessing the data by walking a cursor through the database will greatly mitigate the large data set behavior describe above because each I/O into the cache will satisfy a fairly large number of subsequent data requests.</p>
<p>In the absence of information on application data and data access patterns, for small data sets either the Btree or Hash access methods will suffice. For data sets larger than the cache, we normally recommend using the Btree access method. If you have truly large data, then the Hash access method may be a better choice. The db_stat utility is a useful tool for monitoring how well your cache is performing.</p>
