<h1 id="data-access-and-data-management">Data access and data management</h1>

<p>Fundamentally, database systems provide two services.</p>
<p>The first service is <em>data access</em>. Data access means adding new data to the database (inserting), finding data of interest (searching), changing data already stored (updating), and removing data from the database (deleting). All databases provide these services. How they work varies from category to category, and depends on the record structure that the database supports.</p>
<p>Each record in a database is a collection of values. For example, the record for an online customer might include a name, email address, shipping address, and payment information. Records are usually stored in tables. Each table holds records of the same kind. For example, the <strong>customer</strong> table in an e-commerce web app might store the customer records for every person who shopped at the site. Often, database records have a different structure from the structures or instances supported by the programming language in which an application is written. As a result, working with records can mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>using database operations like searches and updates on records</li>
<li>converting between programming language structures and database record types in the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second service is <em>data management</em>. Data management is more complicated than data access. Providing good data management services is the hard part of building a database system. When you choose a database system to use in an application you build, making sure it supports the data management services you need is critical.</p>
<p>Data management services include allowing multiple users to work on the database simultaneously (concurrency), allowing multiple records to be changed instantaneously (transactions), and surviving application and system crashes (recovery). Different database systems offer different data management services. Data management services are entirely independent of the data access services listed above. For example, nothing about relational database theory requires that the system support transactions, but most commercial relational systems do.</p>
<p>Concurrency means that multiple users can operate on the database at the same time. Support for concurrency ranges from none (single-user access only) to complete (many readers and writers working simultaneously).</p>
<p>Transactions permit users to make multiple changes appear at once. For example, a transfer of funds between bank accounts needs to be a transaction because the balance in one account is reduced and the balance in the other increases. If the reduction happened before the increase, than a poorly-timed system crash could leave the customer poorer; if the bank used the opposite order, then the same system crash could make the customer richer. Obviously, both the customer and the bank are best served if both operations happen at the same instant.</p>
<p>Transactions have well-defined properties in database systems. They are atomic, so that the changes happen all at once or not at all. They are consistent, so that the database is in a legal state when the transaction begins and when it ends. They are typically isolated, which means that any other users in the database cannot interfere with them while they are in progress. And they are durable, so that if the system or application crashes after a transaction finishes, the changes are not lost. Together, the properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability are known as the ACID properties.</p>
<p>As is the case for concurrency, support for transactions varies among databases. Some offer atomicity without making guarantees about durability. Some ignore isolatability, especially in single-user systems; there&#39;s no need to isolate other users from the effects of changes when there are no other users.</p>
<p>Another important data management service is recovery. Strictly speaking, recovery is a procedure that the system carries out when it starts up. The purpose of recovery is to guarantee that the database is complete and usable. This is most important after a system or application crash, when the database may have been damaged. The recovery process guarantees that the internal structure of the database is good. Recovery usually means that any completed transactions are checked, and any lost changes are reapplied to the database. At the end of the recovery process, applications can use the database as if there had been no interruption in service.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a number of data management services that permit copying of data. For example, most database systems are able to import data from other sources, and to export it for use elsewhere. Also, most systems provide some way to back up databases and to restore in the event of a system failure that damages the database. Many commercial systems allow hot backups, so that users can back up databases while they are in use. Many applications must run without interruption, and cannot be shut down for backups.</p>
<p>A particular database system may provide other data management services. Some provide browsers that show database structure and contents. Some include tools that enforce data integrity rules, such as the rule that no employee can have a negative salary. These data management services are not common to all systems, however. Concurrency, recovery, and transactions are the data management services that most database vendors support.</p>
<p>Deciding what kind of database to use means understanding the data access and data management services that your application needs. Berkeley DB is an embedded database that supports fairly simple data access with a rich set of data management services. To highlight its strengths and weaknesses, we can compare it to other database system categories.</p>
