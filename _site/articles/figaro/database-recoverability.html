<h1 id="database-recoverability">Database Recoverability</h1>

<p>Berkeley DB does not protect against all cases of stable storage hardware failure, nor does it protect against simple hardware misbehavior (for example, a disk controller writing incorrect data to the disk). However, configuring the database for checksums will ensure that any such corruption is detected.</p>
<p>Berkeley DB recovery is based on write-ahead logging. This means that when a change is made to a database page, a description of the change is written into a log file. This description in the log file is guaranteed to be written to stable storage before the database pages that were changed are written to stable storage. This is the fundamental feature of the logging system that makes durability and rollback work.</p>
<p>If the application or system crashes, the log is reviewed during recovery. Any database changes described in the log that were part of committed transactions and that were never written to the actual database itself are written to the database as part of recovery. Any database changes described in the log that were never committed and that were written to the actual database itself are backed-out of the database as part of recovery. This design allows the database to be written lazily, and only blocks from the log file have to be forced to disk as part of transaction commit.</p>
<h2 id="recovery-interfaces">Recovery Interfaces</h2>
<p>There are two interfaces that are a concern when considering recoverability:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interface between Figaro and the operating system/file system.</li>
<li>The interface between the operating system/file system and the underlying stable storage hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-osfile-system-interface">The OS/File System Interface</h4>
<p>Figaro uses the operating system interfaces and its underlying file system when writing its files. This means that Figaro can fail if the underlying file system fails in some unrecoverable way. Otherwise, the interface requirements here are simple: The system call that Figaro uses to flush data to disk (normally <code>fsync</code> or <code>fdatasync</code>), must guarantee that all the information necessary for a file&#39;s recoverability has been written to stable storage before it returns to Berkeley DB, and that no possible application or system crash can cause that file to be unrecoverable.</p>
<h4 id="the-oshardware-interface">The OS/Hardware Interface</h4>
<h4 id="page-size">Page Size</h4>
<p>First, it is necessary to consider the underlying page size of the Berkeley DB databases. The database library performs all database writes using the page size specified by the application, and Figaro assumes pages are written atomically. This means that if the operating system performs file system I/O in blocks of different sizes than the database page size, it may increase the possibility for database corruption. For example, assume that Figaro is writing 32KB pages for a database, and the operating system does file system I/O in 16KB blocks. If the operating system writes the first 16KB of the database page successfully, but crashes before being able to write the second 16KB of the database, the database has been corrupted and this corruption may or may not be detected during recovery. For this reason, it may be important to select database page sizes that will be written as single block transfers by the underlying operating system. If you do not select a page size that the underlying operating system will write as a single block, you may want to configure the database to use checksums (see the <a class="xref" href="../../api/Figaro.ContainerConfig.html#Figaro_ContainerConfig_Checksum">Checksum</a> flag for more information). By configuring checksums, you guarantee this kind of corruption will be detected at the expense of the CPU required to generate the checksums. When such an error is detected, the only course of recovery is to perform catastrophic recovery to restore the database.</p>
<p>Second, if you are copying database files (either as part of doing a hot backup or creation of a hot failover area), there is an additional question related to the page size of the databases. You must copy databases atomically, in units of the database page size. In other words, the reads made by the copy program must not be interleaved with writes by other threads of control, and the copy program must read the databases in multiples of the underlying database page size. Generally, this is not a problem, as operating systems already make this guarantee and system utilities normally read in power-of-2 sized chunks, which are larger than the largest possible Berkeley DB database page size.</p>
<h4 id="storage-hardware-configuration">Storage Hardware Configuration</h4>
<p>Third, it is necessary to consider the behavior of the system&#39;s underlying stable storage hardware. For example, consider a SCSI controller that has been configured to cache data and return to the operating system that the data has been written to stable storage, when, in fact, it has only been written into the controller RAM cache. If power is lost before the controller is able to flush its cache to disk, and the controller cache is not stable (that is, the writes will not be flushed to disk when power returns), the writes will be lost. If the writes include database blocks, there is no loss because recovery will correctly update the database. If the writes include log file blocks, it is possible that transactions that were already committed may not appear in the recovered database, although the recovered database will be coherent after a crash.</p>
<p>If the underlying hardware can fail in any way so that only part of the block was written, the failure conditions are the same as those described previously for an operating system failure that writes only part of a logical database block. In such cases, configuring the database for checksums will ensure the corruption is detected.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it may be important to select hardware that does not do partial writes and does not cache data writes (or does not return that the data has been written to stable storage until it has either been written to stable storage or the actual writing of all of the data is guaranteed, barring catastrophic hardware failure -- that is, your disk drive exploding).</p>
<p>If the disk drive on which you are storing your databases explodes, you can perform normal catastrophic recovery, because it requires only a snapshot of your databases plus the log files you have archived since those snapshots were taken. In this case, you should lose no database changes at all.</p>
<p>If the disk drive on which you are storing your log files explodes, you can also perform catastrophic recovery, but you will lose any database changes made as part of transactions committed since your last archival of the log files. Alternatively, if your database environment and databases are still available after you lose the log file disk, you should be able to dump your databases. However, you may see an inconsistent snapshot of your data after doing the dump, because changes that were part of transactions that were not yet committed may appear in the database dump. Depending on the value of the data, a reasonable alternative may be to perform both the database dump and the catastrophic recovery and then compare the databases created by the two methods.</p>
<p>Regardless, for these reasons, storing your databases and log files on different disks should be considered a safety measure as well as a performance enhancement.</p>
