<h1 id="locks">Locks</h1>

<p>When one thread of control wants to obtain access to an object, it requests a lock for that object. This lock is what allows Figaro to provide your application with its transactional isolation guarantees by ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>no other thread of control can read that object (in the case of an exclusive lock)</li>
<li>no other thread of control can modify that object (in the case of an exclusive or non-exclusive lock)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lock-resources">Lock Resources</h2>
<p>When locking occurs, there are three resources in use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The locker.</strong> This is the thing that holds the lock. In a transactional application, the locker is a transaction handle. For non-transactional operations, the locker is a cursor or a Container, Database, or some document management handle.</li>
<li><strong>The lock.</strong> This is the actual data structure that locks the object. In Figaro, a locked object structure in the lock manager is representative of the object that is locked.
( <strong>The locked object.</strong> The thing that your application actually wants to lock. In a Figaro application, the locked object is usually a database page, which in turn contains multiple database entries (key and data). Note that if you use node-level containers, your documents are split into multiple database records. Therefore, when you read or write an XML document that is stored in a node container, you may be locking multiple database pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure how many total lockers, locks, and locked objects your application is allowed to support. See <a class="xref" href="configuring-the-locking-subsystem.html">Configuring the Locking Subsystem</a> for details.</p>
<p>The following figure shows a transaction handle, <code>Txn A</code>, that is holding a lock on database page 002. In this graphic, <code>Txn A</code> is the locker, and the locked object is page 002. Only a single lock is in use in this operation.</p>
<p><strong>A sample lock</strong>

<h2 id="types-of-locks">Types of Locks</h2>
<p>Figaro applications support both exclusive and non-exclusive locks. Exclusive locks are granted when a locker wants to write to an object. For this reason, exclusive locks are also sometimes called write locks.</p>
<p>An exclusive lock prevents any other locker from obtaining any sort of a lock on the object. This provides isolation by ensuring that no other locker can observe or modify an exclusively locked object until the locker is done writing to that object.</p>
<p>Non-exclusive locks are granted for read-only access. For this reason, non-exclusive locks are also sometimes called <em>read locks</em>. Since multiple lockers can simultaneously hold read locks on the same object, read locks are also sometimes called <em>shared locks</em>.</p>
<p>A non-exclusive lock prevents any other locker from modifying the locked object while the locker is still reading the object. This is how transactional cursors are able to achieve repeatable reads; by default, the cursor&#39;s transaction holds a read lock on any object that the cursor has examined until such a time as the transaction is committed or aborted. You can avoid these read locks by using snapshot isolation. See <a class="xref" href="snapshot-isolation.html">Snapshot Isolation</a> for details.</p>
<p>In the following figure, <code>Txn A</code> and <code>Txn B</code> are both holding read locks on page 002, while <code>Txn C</code> is holding a write lock on page 003:</p>
<p><img src="/images/rwlocks1.jpg" alt="Read write locks"></p>
<h2 id="lock-lifetime">Lock Lifetime</h2>
<p>A locker holds its locks until such a time as it does not need the lock any more. What this means is:</p>
<p>A transaction holds any locks that it obtains until the transaction is committed or aborted.
All non-transaction operations hold locks until such a time as the operation is completed. For cursor operations, the lock is held until the cursor is moved to a new position or closed.</p>
