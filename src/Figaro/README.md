#Figaro Documentation Library
This library exists for one single purpose - to document the Figaro .NET API. Trying to get good documentation out of the C++ 
compiler proved to be far too difficult and tedious, and in this particular instance ReSharper (and other documentation tools catering to C#) also came in very handy. 

The Figaro documentation is "full" - in other words, it does NOT build out according to product type. Developers/users 
get the full documentation version in order to make decisions for themselves which features/functionality they want to use.
